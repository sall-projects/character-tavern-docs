Welcome to Character Tavern! This guide explains our platform's currency, **Puni**, and how it integrates with our Free and Premium membership tiers, allowing you to unlock diverse AI character experiences.

## What is Puni?

Puni is the virtual currency of Character Tavern. It's designed to give you access to more advanced AI models and special platform features.

* **Purpose:** Primarily used to interact with **Premium** and **Frontier** AI models.
* **Free Models:** Our range of Free AI models are accessible to everyone without any Puni cost.

## How Puni is Used: Accessing AI Models

Puni is your key to unlocking more sophisticated AI interactions. The Puni cost per message for accessing Premium and Frontier models is directly determined by the `cost` attribute specified in each model's definition.

### Free AI Models
* **Cost:** **0 Puni** (Completely free for everyone). These models have a `cost` of 0 in their definitions.
* Their features, like `memoryType`, are available as defined.

### Premium AI Models
* **Cost for Free ("Explorer") Users:** The Puni cost per message for Premium Models typically ranges from **10 to 25 Puni**, depending on the specific model chosen. This cost is determined by the `cost` attribute defined for that model. (Note: Free users will use standard memory with these models, not "Infinite Memory," even if the model's base definition includes it).
* **Cost for Premium Users:** **0 Puni** (Unlimited access, including any special memory features like "Infinite Memory" as defined by the model, is a benefit of the Premium subscription).
* Premium models offer enhanced creativity, reasoning, and conversational abilities, with varying Puni costs for Free users based on the specific model chosen.

### Frontier AI Models
* **Accessibility for Free ("Explorer") Users:** These models are not accessible to Free users.
* **Cost for Premium Users:** The Puni cost per message for Frontier Models typically ranges from **35 to 110 Puni**, depending on the specific model chosen. This cost is determined by the `cost` attribute defined for that model and will be drawn from their monthly Puni allowance or purchased Puni.
* Frontier models represent the most advanced AI capabilities and have higher Puni `cost` values, reflecting their advanced nature.

*(Important Note: The Puni cost per message for using Premium models (for Free users) and Frontier models (for Premium users) is directly taken from the `cost` attribute within each model's official definition. While the ranges above provide a general idea, please refer to the specific model's information for its exact Puni `cost` per message.)*
