# Getting Started with Character Tavern

Hey there, I'm Sal! Welcome to Character Tavern! I'm so excited you're here and ready to dive in. My goal with this page is to get you up and running fast â€“ from finding your first AI Character Card to starting a chat, and even thinking about creating your own.

Let's get you settled in!

## Step 1: Do I Need an Account? (Browse vs. Interacting)

Good news first: you can totally explore what Character Tavern has to offer without signing up immediately!
* Just head to the **[homepage](https://character-tavern.com/)** to see some of the best and most interesting Cards right now.
* You can also check out the main **[Character Catalog](https://character-tavern.com/character/catalog)** to see the wide variety of Cards our community has created.

However, if you want to actually **chat with these AI Character Cards** or **create your own**, you'll need an account. Itâ€™s quick, I promise!

**How to Create Your Account:**
* The easiest way is to find a Card you like and click the "Chat on Character Tavern" button. If you're not logged in, I'll prompt you to log in or create an account. Just look for the "Don't have an account? **Create an Account**" option.
* Alternatively, you can head directly to the [**Registration Page**](https://character-tavern.com/register) to sign up.

## Step 2: Finding Your First Character Card

Alright, account or not, let's find you a Card to check out!

* **The Catalog & Homepage:** As mentioned, the [**Homepage**](https://character-tavern.com/) shows off some top picks, and the [**Catalog**](https://character-tavern.com/character/catalog) is your main hub for Browse.
* **Search Power:** Got something specific in mind? Use the **search bar**! You can look for names, themes, or anything that sparks your interest.
* **Tailor Your View (Important!):**
    * To make sure you see exactly what you're looking for (or want to avoid), head into the **Content Warning settings** on the platform. Here, you can enable visibility for different types of content, including things like Sexual Content (disabled by Default). I built CT for freedom, and that includes giving you control over what you see.
    * You can also **sort Cards** by "most liked," "trending," and other options to see what's popular in the community.

## Step 3: Starting Your First Chat!

Found a Card that looks cool? Awesome!

1.  **Click on the Card:** This will take you to its detail page where you can see all its info, lore, tags, and what other users are saying in the comments (if available).
2.  **Time to Chat:** You'll see two main buttons:
    * `Chat on Character Tavern`: This is the button you want for the smoothest experience right here on the platform. It's convenient and what I recommend for most users, especially when you're starting out.
    * `Download for SillyTavern`: This one's for the power users who use SillyTavern. It's a bit more advanced, so maybe save exploring this for later once you're comfortable.
3.  **Your First Conversation:** When you click "Chat on Character Tavern" (and you're logged in), you'll jump right into the chat!
    * **No Stress About Models:** For your first chat, you'll automatically use our fantastic **"Aria Classic" model**. Itâ€™s a great, unlimited (free!) model, perfect for getting a feel for things. After your first try, you can always explore and change AI models in your chat settings if you want to experiment with Puni or your Premium benefits!

## Step 4: Feeling Creative? Make or Import Your First Card!

One of the best parts of Character Tavern is bringing your *own* AI characters to life or bringing over your existing favorites!
* **Where to Go:** You can find the **Card Creator** linked in the top menu of the site, or head there directly: [**Character Creator**](https://character-tavern.com/character/creator).
* **Create from Scratch:** Don't feel pressured to make a super complex Card right away if you're starting fresh. Even a Card with a name, a fun greeting, and a short description can lead to amazing roleplays. The creator has lots of options, but you can fill those in as you learn.
* **Already have Cards elsewhere?** Good news! You can import your existing characters from `venus.chub.ai` or SillyTavern directly into Character Tavern via the Card Creator. You'll find options there to bring your favorites over easily â€“ more info on the specific import steps is available right in the creator interface.
* For a full deep dive into all the settings and how to craft the ultimate Card from scratch, check out our more detailed **[Character Creation Guide](./character-creation-guide)** (Link to your future detailed guide).

## What's Next on Your Adventure?

You've got the basics! Now what?

* **Explore, Explore, Explore:** Chat with more Cards! See what the community has created.
* **Experiment with Models:** After your first chat with Aria Classic, try checking out the chat settings to see how different models impact your conversations.
* **Understand Puni & Premium:** If you want to access more powerful AI models, learn about our platform currency and subscriptions. Check out the **[Understanding Puni & Premium page](./premium)**.
* **Join the Community:** Seriously, the best way to enhance your CT experience is to join our [**Discord Server**](https://link.character-tavern.com/discord) (you'll find this link on the About page too!). Share your creations, get help, give feedback directly to me, and just hang out with other roleplay enthusiasts.

I'm really happy to have you here at Character Tavern. My goal was to create a space where we can all enjoy AI roleplay with freedom and creativity. If you have questions, the Discord is the best place to ask!

Happy roleplaying!

- Sal
