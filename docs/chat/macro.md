# Macros Quick Reference: `{{user}}` & `{{char}}`

Hey, Sal here! ðŸ‘‹ Character Tavern uses simple text placeholders called **Macros** to personalize your chats.
The main ones you'll use are `{{user}}` (that's you!) and `{{char}}` (the AI character).

Hereâ€™s how they work:

| Macro     | Replaced With                 | Primary Use / Example                                                               |
| :-------- | :---------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{{user}}`| Your active Persona's name    | **AI Greets You:** "Hi `{{user}}`!"<br />Becomes: "Hi YourPersonaName!"                 |
| `{{char}}`| The AI Character's own name   | **Character Self-Reference:** "`{{char}}` is happy."<br />Becomes: "CharacterName is happy." |

**Where to use them:**
You can sprinkle these into your **AI Character Card** fields (like Greetings, Descriptions, Scenarios) and in your **Persona Description**.

That's it! Simple, right? These two macros add a great personal touch without any fuss.
