# Memory: Keeping the Conversation Alive

On Character Tavern, we want your chats with AI characters to feel as natural and continuous as possible. A big part of that is how we handle memory ‚Äì what the AI remembers from your ongoing conversation. We've got a couple of cool systems in place: Smart Context and Infinite Memory, plus a handy Summarization feature. Let's break down what they do.

## üß© Smart Context

Think of Smart Context as your clever assistant for managing chat memory efficiently. It's designed to get the best performance out of the AI while also being mindful of how much data is being used.

Here's the gist:
* **Intelligent Optimization:** Smart Context doesn't just blindly send everything to the AI. It looks at your conversation and prioritizes the parts that are most important for keeping the chat coherent and engaging.
* **Balancing Act:** It's all about finding the sweet spot between a rich, memorable conversation and not overloading the system. This helps keep things running smoothly and can even be more cost-effective.

Essentially, Smart Context works to ensure the AI has the crucial bits of your chat history at its "fingertips" without getting bogged down in less critical details.

## ‚ôæÔ∏è Infinite Memory

Infinite Memory is our premium approach designed to make your conversations feel like they can go on forever without the AI forgetting crucial details. It's a two-pronged system that really expands what the AI can recall compared to many other platforms.

Here's how it works:

1.  **Utilizing the Full Context:** Unlike some platforms that might limit how much of your chat history is sent to the AI (even if the AI model itself could handle more), Character Tavern strives to use the *entire* available context window. For example, if a model supports a 128K context, we aim to use all of that space if your conversation needs it. For most chats that stay under this large limit, this means *everything* you've discussed gets sent to the AI. This alone makes your AI's memory feel significantly more expansive.

2.  **Smart Optimizations Beyond the Limit:** Now, what happens if your epic story *does* exceed even these large context limits? That's where the "true magic" of Infinite Memory kicks in. Instead of just cutting off the oldest parts of the conversation, the system intelligently optimizes your prompt.
    * It identifies and compresses parts of the conversation that the AI might struggle with or that have less impact on the immediate next response. For instance, the very middle of a long chat often has less influence on the current turn than the beginning or the most recent messages.
    * Various other optimization techniques are employed behind the scenes to condense the information, ensuring the most salient points are retained.

While it's not *truly* infinite (because there are always technical limits), the goal is to make it *feel* genuinely limitless for the vast majority of your interactions. It's designed to be up to 10 times more effective than Smart Context at preserving your chat history, especially for those super long, in-depth roleplays.

## üìù Manual Summaries (Alpha Feature)

To give you another layer of control over your AI's memory, especially during those marathon chat sessions, we've rolled out a manual Summarization tool. Think of it as a way to jot down the key takeaways or plot points of your conversation, ensuring the AI (and you!) can easily recall them.

**Heads Up:** This feature is currently in its **Alpha** phase. That means it's brand new, and we're still actively working on it. Your experiences and thoughts are super valuable as we polish it up!

**Crucial Detail:** Right now, these manual summaries are **only compatible if you have the "Smart Prompt" feature enabled**. You'll find the summarization options within your "Memory Settings."

**What You Can Do with Summarization v2 Alpha:**

* **Get an AI Assist:** Don't want to write a summary from scratch? You can have the AI generate one for you. This can be a great starting point or a quick way to get a refresher on what's happened.
* **You're the Editor-in-Chief:** Whether the AI drafts it or you start fresh, you have complete control. You can edit, add, or remove parts of the summary to make sure it perfectly captures the essence of your chat.
* **Built for Smart Prompt:** The summarization tool is currently designed to work hand-in-hand with our "Smart Prompt" system and the Prompt Builder for the best results.
* **Pick Your Summary Style:**
    * **Premium Summaries:** For a deeper, more nuanced overview that really gets into the character and story details, you can opt for a Premium Summary. This costs a little bit (just 2 Puni each time you generate one).
    * **Free Summaries:** Need a quick summary without any cost? The Free Summaries are unlimited and won't cost you any Puni.
* **Look Back at Past Notes:** The system keeps a history of the summaries you've generated, so you can easily access and review them later.

**How It Looks and Feels:**

When you open the summarization tool, you'll see a space where your generated summary will show up. You'll have a few buttons to interact with:

* A way to **Save any changes** you make to the current summary.
* An option to **Generate a New Summary**. If you choose this, and if you're interested in the more detailed version, you can select to **Use Premium Summary** (it'll show the 2 Puni cost). The system will also remind you that "Premium summaries provide higher quality analysis with better character and story understanding."
* A button to **Show Previous Summaries**, which will also show you how many you've already saved.

Because this is an Alpha, we're counting on users like you to help us make it even better. So dive in, try it out (with Smart Prompt enabled!), and let us know what you think!

We hope these memory features help you create even more engaging and immersive experiences on Character Tavern!
