# Welcome to the Character Tavern Docs

Yo! Sal here – the one-person crew building Character Tavern (CT). So stoked you've landed in the official docs! If you're looking to get the real scoop on how I'm aiming to flip the script on AI roleplay and what CT is all about, you're definitely in the right spot.

**Quick Vibe Check: What IS Character Tavern, from my perspective?**

Basically, I built Character Tavern (CT) to be your new creative sanctuary where you can **create, share, and discuss with AI Characters** – which we affectionately call **'Cards'** here on CT. It's all about giving you **legit total freedom** with these Cards. My mission here is simple: to provide *you* with the tools and the space to not only dream up and build these Cards, but also to share them, and actually **own** your creations. Especially if, like me, you're tired of being creatively boxed in elsewhere (*cough* you know who *cough* 😉). If you're hunting for a platform that *finally* gets it, congrats, you've made it.

Want to dive even deeper into the 'why' behind CT, my core values, and the full vision? You can always check out the main [**About Character Tavern page**](https://character-tavern.com/about)!

**What I Stand For (My Core Principles for CT):**

* ✨ **Unleash Your Brain:** Seriously, I want you to go wild. Create those detailed OCs (now you know they're Cards!), explore any storyline your heart desires. Your imagination is the main character here, and I'm just providing the stage.
* 🤝 **Community is Everything:** Even though I'm steering this ship solo for now, CT is all about *us*. I'm building this space for you to share your epic Cards, discover absolute gems from other creators, and just vibe with awesome, like-minded people.
* 🔓 **Your Cards, Your Rules:** No gatekeeping, ever. My goal is for you to be able to download your Character Cards and use 'em wherever, whenever. They belong to YOU. Full stop. That's non-negotiable for me.
* 🎉 **Make it Fun:** Because if you're not having a blast, then what are we even doing here? Roleplay should be enjoyable, and I'm committed to keeping CT a fun zone.

**So, What's in These Docs?**

Think of these docs as your ultimate guide to not just using CT, but truly making it your own. Here, I'll spill all the tea on:

* **🚀 Getting Started:** Your launchpad to making the most of CT from the jump – from finding Cards to chatting with them.
* **🎭 Creating & Sharing Cards:** All my tips and tricks to help you bring your Character Cards to life and share them (or keep 'em for your private adventures, no judgment!).
* **💸 Understanding Puni & Premium:** The full lowdown on our Puni currency and how you can unlock an even more OP experience with Premium. (Definitely check this out!).
* **🤖 Model Mania:** Details on the different AI models you can hook up with your Cards.
* ...and pretty much anything else you need to navigate the Tavern like you own the place.
