# Welcome to the Character Tavern Docs! 🚀

Hey everyone, Sal here! I'm the one building Character Tavern (CT), and I'm genuinely thrilled you've found your way to the official docs. If you're looking to get the full story on how I'm aiming to shake things up in AI roleplay and what CT is truly about, you're in the perfect spot.

**So, What's Character Tavern All About, From My View?**

I built Character Tavern (CT) to be your new creative hub – a place where you can **create, share, and discuss with AI Characters** (which we call **'Cards'** here). My main goal is to offer you **real, total freedom** with these Cards. My mission is simple: to give *you* the tools and the space to not only dream up and build these Cards, but also to share them, and crucially, to actually **own** your creations. This is especially for those of you who, like me, are tired of feeling creatively limited elsewhere (*cough* you know the ones *cough* 😉). If you're looking for a platform that truly respects your vision, then welcome home.

Want to dive even deeper into the 'why' behind CT, my core values, and the full vision? You can always check out the main [**About Character Tavern page**](https://character-tavern.com/about)!

**What I Stand For (My Core Principles for CT):**

* ✨ **Unleash Your Creativity:** Seriously, I want you to feel free to explore. Create those detailed OCs (now you know they're Cards!), dive into any storyline your heart desires. Your imagination is the star here, and I'm just setting the stage.
* 🤝 **Community is Key:** Even though I'm the main dev for now, CT is all about *us* and what we build together. I want this to be a space where you can share your amazing Cards, discover gems from other creators, and connect with awesome, like-minded people.
* 🔓 **Your Cards, Your Control:** No complicated rules about what you can do with your creations. My commitment is that you can download your Character Cards and use them wherever, whenever. They belong to YOU. That's fundamental here.
* 🎉 **Keep it Fun:** Because if it's not enjoyable, what's the point? Roleplay should be a blast, and I'm dedicated to making CT a place where that can happen.

**So, What's in These Docs?**

Think of these docs as your friendly guide to not just using CT, but really making it your own. Here, I'll give you the rundown on:

* **🚀 Getting Started:** Your express lane to making the most of CT right from the start – from finding Cards to chatting with them.
* **🎭 Creating & Sharing Cards:** All my tips and tricks to help you bring your Character Cards to life and share them (or keep them for your private adventures, that's cool too!).
* **💸 Understanding Puni & Premium:** The complete guide to our Puni currency and how you can unlock an even better experience with Premium. (Definitely worth a read!).
* **🤖 Model Mania:** Info on the different AI models you can use with your Cards.
* ...and pretty much everything else you need to navigate the Tavern like a pro.
